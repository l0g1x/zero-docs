title: Generating Zero Schemas
---

Zero provides several community-maintained tools to generate schemas from popular ORMs and database tools.

<Note type="note" heading="Schema Generation">
  Schema generators will only define the tables, columns, and relationships -
  but you will still need to define the permissions.
</Note>

## Community Generators

Generate Zero schemas from existing ORM provider schemas

- [Drizzle](#drizzle-zero)
- [Prisma](#prisma-generator-zero)

## Drizzle

[drizzle-zero](https://github.com/BriefHQ/drizzle-zero) generates Zero schemas from Drizzle ORM schemas. It supports:

- Converting Drizzle schemas to Zero schemas with bidirectional relationships
- Handling all Drizzle column types supported by Zero
- Type-safe schema generation with inferred types from Drizzle
- Support for relationships:
  - One-to-one relationships
  - One-to-many relationships
  - Many-to-many relationships with junction tables
  - Self-referential relationships
- Custom schemas and column mappings

### Installation

```bash
npm install drizzle-zero
# or
yarn add drizzle-zero
# or
pnpm add drizzle-zero
```

### Usage

1. Define your Drizzle schema
2. Add the schema generation script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate": "drizzle-zero generate --format",
    "postinstall": "npm generate"
  }
}
```

3. Import and use the generated schema in your Zero application

## Prisma

[prisma-generator-zero](https://github.com/passionfroot/prisma-generator-zero) generates Zero schemas from Prisma schemas. It provides:

- Automatic conversion of Prisma models to Zero schemas
- Support for Prisma's data types and relationships
- Type-safe schema generation
- Integration with Prisma's development workflow

### Installation

```bash
npm install prisma-generator-zero
# or
yarn add prisma-generator-zero
# or
pnpm add prisma-generator-zero
```

### Usage

1. Add the generator to your `schema.prisma`:

```ts
generator zero {
  provider = "prisma-generator-zero"
}
```

2. Run Prisma generate to create the Zero schema
3. Import and use the generated schema in your Zero application
